## Python
This is a python and Jupyter notebook project.
The purpose of this project is to follow some random ML tutorials from the web (listed below) for classifying VIDEO contents. I may have merged some of their ideas and played around with putting different data through them.
It uses Anaconda on python 3.8 with extra requirements declared in the requirements.txt. Some may be missing and should be added with pip install. Each notebook starts with an import section so this is easy.
